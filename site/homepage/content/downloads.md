## Binaries

Eclipse Hono's service components are provided by means of pre-built Docker images available from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/eclipse/). These container images can be deployed to popular
container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift.

The release archive contains all files necessary to deploy Hono to a Kubernetes cluster using the
[Helm package manager](https://helm.sh).

* [Eclipse Hono 1.0-M6 Archive](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/hono/eclipse-hono-1.0-M6-chart.tar.gz)

Download and extract the archive and follow the [deployment guide]({{% doclink "/deployment/helm-based-deployment/" %}}).

A Java based command line client for consuming telemetry data and events from Hono is available for download as well:

* [Eclipse Hono 1.0-M6 Command Line Client](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/hono/hono-cli-1.0-M6-exec.jar)

The client requires a Java 11 runtime environment to run.

Please refer to the [Admin Guide]({{% doclink "/admin-guide/hono-client-configuration/" %}}) for details regarding the command
line options that the client supports.

## Source Code

The source code can be cloned (using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)) or downloaded from the [Eclipse Hono GitHub repository]
(https://github.com/eclipse/hono). The [Building from Source]({{% doclink "/dev-guide/building_hono/" %}})
guide provides instructions on how to build Hono locally.
